    Mouse - $10.99
    Keyboard - $40.99

    Keyboards are 10% off
    Buy 2 Monitors and get a desk lamp at half price
    Buy any 2 items or more and get a maximum of $10 off shipping fees

and finally display a total detailed invoice in USD.

The customer can select the products that will be added to the shopping cart by inserting the product's name.

The program will display the contents of the shoppingcart after each insertion, returning an error message if the input is incorrect (Ex: "wecbcam" instead of "Webcam") and will generate a detailed invoice after "checkout" input is entered by the customer. 

At the end a detailed Invoice will be generated and printed, containing all the detailed sums: subtotal, total VAT, total shipping fee, total discounts, total sum remaining.
